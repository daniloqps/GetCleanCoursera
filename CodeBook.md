In synthesis, the dataset have: "The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ." [ref: features_info.txt]

The dataset contains two principals types of data:

- DTrain: Training set. [X_train.txt]
- DTest: Test set. [X_test.txt]

Both datasets contains the same columns/variables quantity with their measurement, totaling 561, described in [features.txt]
and  "- Each feature vector is a row on the text file." [ref: README.txt]

The rows/observations in DTrain are different of DTest.
The name of columns are listed in [features.txt] totaling 561 names. "- 'features.txt': List of all features." [ref: README.txt]

The Dataset have 2 aditional files, that complements the information about de observations
