##Study Design

In synthesis, the dataset have: 

            "The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer 
            and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.". [features_info.txt]

and was collected 

            "The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers
            within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six
            activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING,
            STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the
            waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured
            3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant
            rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the
            data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into
            two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the
            training data and 30% the test data. " [README.txt]


## Codebook

The dataset contains 2 principals types of data:

- DTrain: Training set. [X_train.txt]()
- DTest: Test set. [X_test.txt]()

Both files contains the same columns/variables quantity with their measurement, totaling 561, described in [features.txt]()
This variables has 2 domains, indicates by prefix "t" or "f":

- Time domain signals. ex: tBodyAcc-mean()-X
- Frequency domain signals. ex: fBodyAcc-mean()-X 

and the units are:

- Accelerometer Units: standard gravity units 'g'
- Gyroscope: The units are radians/second. 

and 

            "- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1]." [README.txt]

The rows/observations in DTrain and DTest are different and must be linked easily since 

            "- Each feature vector is a row on the text file." [README.txt]

The dataset have 6 additional files, that complements the information about the observations

- LTrain: Training Labels [y_train.txt]() (activity identifiers 1..6 - described as WALKING...LAYING)
- LTest: Test Labels [y_test.txt]() (activity identifiers 1..6 - described as WALKING...LAYING)

- STrain: Training Subject. [subject_train.txt]() (volunteers who performed the training 1..30)
- STest:  Test Subject. [subject_test.txt]() (volunteers who performed the test 1..30)

- ActLabels: 6 Activity Labels used to describe the itens in LTrain and LTest. [activity_labels.txt]()
- Features: Name of the measurements totally 561. [features.txt]()

##Normalizing
So, to normalize the raw-data described above and turn in tidy-data, we need to follow the next steps

1. Bind the same data in only one file

            DTrain    + LTrain    + STrain = FullTrain
            DTest     + LTest     + STest  = FullTest
            FullTrain + FullTest  = AllSet

2. Combine the describe information to become more readable
            
            AllSet + ActLabels = CompleteSet

3. Select only necessary infomation to use in analysis

            extract only 'Mean()' and 'Std()' for each measurement.
