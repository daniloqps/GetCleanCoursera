This file was built to describe all processes applied to get and clean a complex dataset using R Programming Language.
Below, is reproduced the property information about this dataset, copied from the original README.txt

In synthesis, the dataset have: "The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ." [ref: features_info.txt]

The dataset contains two principals types of data:

- DTrain: Training set. [X_train.txt]
- DTest: Test set. [X_test.txt]

Both datasets contains the same columns/variables quantity with their measurement, totaling 561, described in [features.txt]
This variables has 2 domains, indicates by prefix "t" or "f":
- Time domain signals (ex. tBodyAcc-mean()-X )
- Frequency domain signals (ex. fBodyAcc-mean()-X )

The rows/observations in DTrain and DTest are different and must be linked easily. "- Each feature vector is a row on the text file." [ref: README.txt]

The Dataset have 5 additional files, that complements the information about the observations

- LTrain: Training Labels [y_train.txt] (activity identifiers 1..6 - WALKING...LAYING)
- LTest: Test Labels [y_test.txt] (activity identifiers 1..6 - WALKING...LAYING)
and
- STrain: Training Subject [subject_train.txt] (volunteers who performed the training 1..30)
- STest:  Test Subject [subject_test.txt] (volunteers who performed the test 1..30)
and
- ActLabels: 6 Activity Labels [activity_labels.txt]
