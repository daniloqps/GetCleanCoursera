# Script run_analysis.R

#Step 1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
#Step 2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
#Step 3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
#Step 4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
#Step 5: From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#Rules

#Please upload the tidy data set created in step 5 of the instructions. Please upload your data set 
#as a txt file created with write.table() using row.name=FALSE (do not cut and paste a dataset directly 
#into the text box, as this may cause errors saving your submission).

      #Has the student submitted a tidy data set? Either a wide or a long form of the data is acceptable if 
      #it meets the tidy data principles of week 1 (Each variable you measure should be in one column, 
      #Each different observation of that variable should be in a different row).
      
      
#Please submit a link to a Github repo with the code for performing your analysis. 
#The code should have a file run_analysis.R in the main directory that can be run as 
#long as the Samsung data is in your working directory. The output should be the tidy 
#data set you submitted for part 1. You should include a README.md in the repo describing 
#how the script works and the code book describing the variables.

      #Did the student submit a Github repo with the required scripts?
      
      #Was code book submitted to GitHub that modifies and updates the 
      #codebooks available to you with the data to indicate all the variables and 
      #summaries you calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information?

      #I was able to follow the README in the directory that explained what the analysis files did.
